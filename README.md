# advent

advent is a mobile scavenger hunt app where you can create and complete "Quests". Quests consist of individual tasks set at specific locations by the quest creator. Players compete by uploading pictures of themselves performing each task. The first player to complete each task of a quest is the winner.

A scavenger hunt can be a fun way to socialize and explore your city. Whether your organization has a prize giveaway and wants to raise awareness or you just have an extra ticket to tonight's show but need some cigarettes, create quests with advent to take care of your needs.
